		<p>You are new to the web developer fold and you open the Sublime editor for the first time.<br>A black space wait just for you, like the white paper in front of the writer. Both want to write something great but only you will do it old school. The writer use Word and you get to write it from scratch. Lucky you! &sung;</p>

		<p>You <em>are</em> actually lucky because Sublime takes pity on those who want to develop webpages and gives some cool tips to make life a little easier...and you're gonna need them.<br>So buckle up, here are some Sublime's helpful shortcuts mixed with tools of the trade for happy coders!</p>

		<h1>These little things that makes your job easier</h1>

		<h2>1. Template or Boilerplate for lazy people</h2>

			<p>If I want to get a html template or boilerplate in the Sublime editor, I need to save the new file as a mytitle.html doc. Then I write <em>html</em> on the first line and press <em>tab</em>. Sublime will provide the basic template. Let's say the truth folks...it's only five tags but we feel like winners not having to write them!</p>

		<h2>2. A good bedside manner: Indentation</h2>

			<p>Indenting our code has two purposes.<br><br>The first one is to write a clean and clear code. It's much easier to read and understand, especially if we come back to it after a year or two.<br><em>Developers won't spit in your food,<br>In spite, dogs won't try to bite you,<br>In your eyes, an ice pick you will not put<br>Everybody wins...especially you!</em></p>

			<p>The second purpose allows us to style different tags the same way. Indenting a tag under another makes it its <strong>child</strong>. By styling the <strong>parent</strong> using CSS, we give any child it has the same properties.</p>

			<p>Good news!<br>We can choose how we indent in Sublime.<br>Go to: Menu &rarr; View &rarr; Indentation then choose your poison<br><br>Fun Fact: People who indent using two spaces win more money that people indenting with tabs...do I really need to continue?(seriously, go check that theory)</p>

			<p class="formula">How do you indent in Sublime?<br>Select the lines you want to indent and press <em>ctrl</em> and <em>]</em>. Use ctrl + [ to unindent if needed</p>

		<h2>3. Another good bedside manner for new coders: Whitespace</h2>

			<p>You should use whitespace while writing your code. Like indentation, it makes for clean and readable code.<br> Whitespace is the habit of putting space between blocks of code. Those spaces do not influence the browser and won't be seen by anybody but you and those working on this code. For the sake of a sane and healthy working environment, use whitespace.<br>Seriously.</p>
